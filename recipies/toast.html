    <p>French toast (pain perdu in French) isn't actually from France. 
        Legend has it that a man named Joseph French from the U.S. 
        created <br> the sweet breakfast dish in 1724 and named it after 
        himself. However, that's probably not true: People were frying 
        milk- and <br> egg-soaked bread in Ancient Rome, according to early recipes.

        It's more likely that modern French toast was invented by 
        15th-century cooks <br> who were on a mission to use up stale 
        bread.</p>
